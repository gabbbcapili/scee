For your convenience I have uploaded it on my personal test server https://scee.aquiware.com/
But if you want to run it on your local machine and review the structure, do the steps below

## Installation
in your terminal navigate to the project and
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan serve
then go to browser and hit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Thank you!
